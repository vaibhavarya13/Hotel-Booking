# Hotel-Booking
Project Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to extract insights through data visualization and predictive modeling. The dataset includes various features such as booking dates, customer demographics, stay duration, and financial details. The objective is to explore trends in bookings, cancellations, and pricing while building regression models to predict the Average Daily Rate (ADR). Visualizations help understand patterns, and machine learning models evaluate the impact of different factors on ADR prediction. The models include Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The project ultimately aims to support better revenue management and operational decision-making in the hospitality industry.

Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to extract valuable insights through data visualization and predictive modeling. The dataset consists of booking details, customer demographics, stay duration, and financial factors affecting hotel revenue. The primary objective is to examine booking trends, cancellation patterns, and price variations while leveraging machine learning models to predict the Average Daily Rate (ADR). A variety of visualizations are used to identify key patterns, and regression models—including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—are employed to evaluate the impact of multiple factors on ADR prediction. The insights gained from this analysis can help hotel management optimize pricing strategies, reduce cancellations, and improve revenue forecasting.

Data Analysis
The data analysis process involves exploring different aspects of the dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and trends. Initially, data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical formats, and standardizing data are performed to ensure consistency. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we visualize the distribution of lead time, ADR, and stay duration to understand customer booking behaviors. Additionally, heatmaps are used to identify correlations between numerical features, highlighting strong relationships that can impact revenue predictions. We also analyze cancellation rates across different market segments to determine the factors influencing customer retention. These insights allow us to make data-driven decisions and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models.

Machine Learning Models Used
Several machine learning models are utilized to predict the Average Daily Rate (ADR). These include:
-Linear Regression: A simple model that assumes a linear relationship between input features and ADR.
-Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear model that splits the data based on feature values to make predictions.
-Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
-Support Vector Regressor (SVR): A regression model that uses support vector machines to fit the best hyperplane for prediction.
The performance of each model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

Results
The performance of each model was assessed using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric. The results indicate that the Random Forest Regressor performed the best among all models, achieving the lowest MSE and demonstrating strong predictive power. The Decision Tree Regressor also provided decent results but showed signs of overfitting. Linear Regression, while useful for interpretability, exhibited higher errors due to its assumption of a linear relationship.Support Vector Regression (SVR) struggled with capturing complex patterns in the data. These findings suggest that ensemble models like Random Forest are more suitable for ADR prediction in hotel booking datasets, providing reliable insights for pricing strategy optimization.
